## Bill

## Alexey

## Felipe
- Needs to reactivate his Princeton Research Computing account;
  - [ ] Contact Eliot for help converting the account to an external collaborator status and reactivating it?
  - Needs to copy fork of PyTorch `timm`

## Yi and Shinjae
- Currently reproducing Michael Churchill's 2019 NeurIPS workshop paper on ECEi data with 
  - `/scratch/gpfs/rmc2/ecei_d3d/data/` 
  - This data is still at the original 1 MHz sampling. He downsampled on-the-fly
  - Transferring the 10 TB to Yi's local workstation; may take 2 days. Local workstation only has 1x GPU (32 GB V100?), so won't do data parallel training at first 
  - ~2K shots in training set used in


## Jesse
- We have at least 6K shots with both LFS and HFS channel data from ECEi. Should expand Churchill's 2019 database when reproducing
- ~25% of the shots have significant low-frequency noise and the channels appear "dead" (std dev < 1 mV); this is different than the significantly greater number of shots will some or all channels "missing"
- Globus DTN at Princeton is limited to 500 GB at a time for Jesse's account. No such limit on ALCF DTN? We can possibly use that as the centralized 

`/projects/FRNN/signal_data_new_REAL_TIME/d3d/ECEI_100kHz/` and 

`/projects/FRNN/signal_data_new_REAL_TIME/d3d/ECEI_HFS_100kHz/`
